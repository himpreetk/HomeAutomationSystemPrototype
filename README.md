📖 Overview
  
    This project presents a prototype of a Home Automation System that enables users to control home appliances like lights and fans using a Java-based Android application over Bluetooth communication. The primary objective is to provide a cost-effective, portable, and 
    easy-to-use solution for smart home control.

🔧 Features

    ✅ Control light and fan via a mobile app.

    ✅ Wireless control using Bluetooth.

    ✅ User-friendly Android interface.

    ✅ Low-cost prototype using embedded systems (Arduino/HC-05).

    ✅ Real-time feedback and appliance status visibility.

📲 How It Works

    1. Pair the Android mobile device with the Bluetooth module (HC-05).

    2. Launch the Home Automation App and connect to the Bluetooth device.

    3. Tap buttons in the app to turn ON/OFF the light and fan.

    4. Bluetooth signals are sent to Arduino which switches the relays.

    5. Appliances respond accordingly and status is displayed in the app.

🧪 Testing

    - Tested successfully on various Android phones.

    - Functional within a range of 10 meters.

    - Safe operation using relay modules to prevent voltage backflow.
